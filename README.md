# Wazuh-SIEM-Home-Lab-Detection-of-Suspicious-Activities
This project documents the setup and demonstration of a Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in a home lab environment. The primary focus is on configuring the SIEM to detect various suspicious activities, including brute-force attacks and the execution of malicious scripts

# Project Overview
The main objective of this home lab is to establish a practical and functional Wazuh SIEM environment. This setup serves as a platform for learning and experimenting with threat detection, log analysis, alert mechanisms, and incident response procedures in a controlled setting.

#### Key activities and demonstrations in this project include:

1) **Wazuh Server Configuration:** Setting up the central Wazuh server for log aggregation and analysis.

2) W**azuh Agent Deployment with Sysmon**: Installing a Wazuh agent on a Windows endpoint and configuring Sysmon for detailed system event logging, providing richer data for analysis.

3) **Custom Rule Development**: Creating a specific Wazuh rule to detect "Failed SSH login attempts on Windows," a scenario that might require custom logic for robust detection.

4) **Attack Simulation (Hydra)**: Conducting a brute-force SSH attack using Hydra against the Windows endpoint to test and demonstrate the custom rule's efficacy.

5) **Malicious Script Analysis**: Executing a known malicious PowerShell script on the monitored endpoint to observe the types of alerts generated by Wazuh and Sysmon.
